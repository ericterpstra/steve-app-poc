# Steve Adore App Skeleton

This repository contains a React application bootstrapped with Vite. It uses React Router v7, Tailwind CSS and Supabase authentication. The project is organized with route components inside `app/src/pages` and shared components under `app/src/components`.

## Getting Started

```bash
cd app
npm install
npm run dev
```

Environment variables for Supabase should be added in `app/.env`:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```
