# 🚢 STEVE (a.k.a. "Dude Where's My Cargo") Business Model (Streamlined Overview)

---

## 1. Core Offering

A consumer-first platform that brings **visibility and control** to international container moves through:

- Real-time container tracking
- Predictive ETAs
- Plain-English alerts
- Educational content (guides, glossaries, timelines)

---

## 2. Target Customer (Initial Focus)

**Primary:**

- Individuals planning or undergoing international moves
- Expats, digital nomads, corporate transferees

**Secondary:**

- Movers and relocation services looking to offer transparency tools or white-label dashboards

---

## 3. Data Acquisition Strategy

STEVE depends on real-world shipping data to deliver value. We prioritize **trust, transparency, and creativity** in our early collection efforts.

### ✅ Phase 1: Manual + User-Contributed

- Container numbers and quote PDFs voluntarily submitted by beta users
- Email forwarding system (e.g., plans@steve.com) to build pricing benchmarks
- Post-move surveys to capture actual outcomes (timeline, fees, satisfaction)

### 🔄 Phase 2: API + Partnership-Driven

- Integrations with 3rd-party container tracking APIs (Vizion, JSONCargo, etc.)
- Partnerships with small and mid-size movers to access anonymized quote data
- Scraping or FOIA of public relocation data (e.g., government contracts)

### 🔐 Privacy & Ethics

- No resale of personal data
- Aggregated insights only
- Explicit consent at every step — **we earn trust by respecting it**

---

## 4. Go-to-Market Strategy

### Phase 1: Validation & Beta

- 5–10 beta users tracked manually
- Feedback loop focused on visibility gaps and information pain points
- Personal outreach via Reddit, FB groups, expat forums

### Phase 2: Organic Content + SEO

- Long-form guides targeting international moving pain points
- Glossaries, lingo explainers, and checklists for search discoverability
- Link from forums, social, and expat blogs

### Phase 3: Partnership & Embeds

- Explore co-branded dashboards with movers
- White-label solutions for relocation services
- Affiliate or embedded widget offerings

---

## 5. Revenue Strategy (Future Focus)

We are not monetizing during beta. Instead, we focus on learning, traction, and trust.

### Future Potential Streams:

- **Consumer**: One-time fee for premium features (tracking, alerts, storage reminders)
- **B2B**: Monthly fee for white-labeled dashboards or lead-gen
- **Insights**: Sale of **aggregated** trend data to port operators, insurers, etc.

## 6. Founders’ Mission (Internal)

STEVE is both a product and a learning platform.

We’re using this build to grow as founders — testing assumptions, working with AI, learning how to ship fast, and fail smarter.

Even if STEVE doesn’t scale, it will have done its job by making us better at the next iteration.
